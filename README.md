# Integrating your repo with GitPod

Any GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab repository can be opened in GitPod by simply prefixing the repository's url with ```gitpod.io/#```.
For example, you can open this repository in github by going to (gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ANRGUSC/gitpod)[gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ANRGUSC/gitpod]

This opens the container in GitPod's default workspace, a linux container with the most common tools and software pre-installed.
